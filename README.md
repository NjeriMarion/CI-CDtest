This README file provides the  instructions on how to set up and run a Django application. It covers installing `pip`, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and running the Django app.
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.10.12
